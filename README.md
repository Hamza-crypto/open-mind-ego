# Requirements

## Make a connection between two plugins
1. Jetformbuilder (contact form plugin)
2. Restrict Content Pro (membership plugin)

In such a way, that according to the user's membership plan, it allows him to send X amount of messages through the form, and that this number is reset every time the user renews his membership..

Also, when the maximum number of messages allowed is reached, it is not allowed to send more messages through the form.


## Invite someone feature
The membership system is with Restrict Content Pro and I wanted to ask you, if you could create an "invite someone" feature that is like giving away a subscription.

When they click on it, a pop up will appear and the person's data will be entered, the plan that is going to be given as a gift, and they will pay for it. And the person will receive an email like "Carlos has invited you for a coffee" and in the email info will appear the username and password and a link to enter.

## Buy more messages feature
That there is the option to be able to buy more messages from "My napkin" I do not know if that we do with Woocommerce and when someone buys add more messages, or if you find it easier with the same Restrict Content Pro.
